# Mini-Project---Analyzing-ECommerce-Business-Performance-With-SQL
Mini Project by Rakamin Academy
In this Mini Project, I act as a member of the Data Analytics team at an eCommerce company. This company is one of the largest marketplaces in South America that connects micro businesses with their customers. As a member of the Data Analytics team, I am responsible for analyzing three aspects related to the company's business performance. These three aspects include customer growth, product quality and payment type. I will process the data provided to create a business performance report on these three aspects.
